# AI & ML ElevateLabs Projects

This repository holds the projects I have completed under **ElevateLabs**, focused on applied machine learning, NLP, and web-based interfaces.

## Projects

### 1. Fake News Detection Web App
A Streamlit-based application that classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using NLP and a Naive Bayes classifier trained on TF-IDF features. It includes basic explanation of predictions based on top contributing words.

### 2. Movie Recommendation System
A hybrid movie recommendation system combining collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and sentiment analysis to deliver personalized movie suggestions to users. The system features an interactive Streamlit interface where users can adjust model weights and preference parameters.
